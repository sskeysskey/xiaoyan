            <div class="content">
                <p>The following terms and conditions govern all use of the gangyan.top website and all content, services, and products available through the website, including, but not limited to, the client area (collectively referred to as the Site).</p>
                <p>The Site is owned and operated by individual named Steven(collectively referred to as the Operator). The Site is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies including, without limitation, the Operator’s privacy policy and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site by the Operator (collectively, the “Agreement”).</p>
                <p>Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Site. By accessing or using any part of the website, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the Site or use any services.</p>
                <h2>Responsibility of Website Visitors</h2>
                <p>By operating the Site, the Operator does not represent or imply that it endorses any or all of the contributed content, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Site may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Operator disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Site.</p>
                <h2>Do We Disclose Any Information to Outside Parties?</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information, except to provide products or services you’ve requested. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
                <h2>Copyright infringement and DMCA policy</h2>
                <p>As the Operator asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by the Site violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify the Operator in accordance with common DMCA policies. The Operator will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate, by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. In the case of a visitor who may infringe or repeatedly infringes the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of the Operator or others, the Operator may, in its discretion, terminate or deny access to and use of the Site. In the case of such termination, the Operator will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to the Operator. You further agree not to change or delete any proprietary notices from materials downloaded from the site. You must retain our copyright notice in the policy you create unless you have purchased a premium policy, in which case you will not have to display our copyright notice in your generated policy.</p>
                <h2>Do we use cookies?</h2>
                <p>Yes, we use cookies (which are small pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer’s hard drive) to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about the site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>
                <h2>Changes</h2>
                <p>The Operator reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the Site following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. The Operator may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the Site (including, the release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
                <h2>Termination</h2>
                <p>The Operator may terminate your access to all or any part of the Site at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may simply discontinue using the Site. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a client account, such account can only be terminated by the Operator if you materially breach this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within 14 (fourteen) days from the Operator’s notice to you thereof; provided that, the Operator can terminate the Site immediately as part of a general shut down of our service. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
                <h2>Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
                <p>The Site is provided “as is”. The Operator and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Neither the Operator nor its suppliers and licensors make any warranty that the Site will be error-free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.
